## Introduction
FuelGuard is designed with the user in mind. Leveraging the power of Sway, it offers MultiSig Wallet encryption, allowing users to transact securely and maintain control over their financial information.

## Privacy & Security
We don't just value privacy and security; we embody it. FuelGuard's core is built on:
- **Encryption Methods**: Utilizing cutting-edge encryption techniques to safeguard user data.
- **Anonymization Techniques**: Ensuring user identity remains confidential and untraceable.
- **Advanced Security Protocols**: Implementing stringent security measures to deter unauthorized access and fraud.

### Built with Sway
FuelGuard leverages Sway's robust framework to enhance privacy and security within the Fuel ecosystem. Together, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.

## Features
- **Multisig Encryption**: Multiple layers of encryption ensure that only authorized parties can access the information.
- **Secure Transactions**: Execute transactions with confidence, knowing that your data is protected.
- **User Control**: Maintain control over your personal and financial information.

## How It Works
FuelGuard operates through a series of smart contracts, functions, and state checks:
- `constructor()`: Set up the multisig wallet.
